This file documents MAVProxy commands and procedures for configuring, managing, and monitoring geofence boundaries to restrict UAV operation area, including loading, saving, and editing geofence coordinates.

# Geofence overview:
- Defines boundaries the UAV cannot cross.
- Triggers failsafe (e.g., RTL) if breached.

# Commands:
fence list               # Show current geofence
fence load <file>        # Load geofence coordinates from file
fence save <file>        # Save current geofence to file
fence draw               # Draw geofence on map (if loaded)
fence enable             # Enable geofence failsafe
fence disable            # Disable geofence failsafe
fence clear              # Delete all geofence coordinates
fence move <n>           # Move geofence point n (select new location on map)
fence remove <n>         # Remove geofence point n

# Notes:
- Copter: geofence is a cylinder (radius/altitude).
- Plane: geofence is a polygon.
